# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
  * Some parts felt really good! On some of the challenges, I either knew exactly how to do it or at least was able to find the lesson that taught a certain element. Usually a quick scan would remind me what I was supposed to be doing, and I could move forward. I have been getting a little better at reading the error messages in my terminal to figure out where I went wrong in the code, and then fix my mistake. I had some frustration in the challenges when I couldn't determine if I was just forgetting something or if it was truly something new I needed to figure out on my own.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
  * I have not been good at taking breaks, and will sometimes push through for 5+ hours. I think I would benefit from breaks since there have been a couple instances where I come back with a clearer mind and can get to an answer... start drawing blanks or get more frustrated.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
  * Make myself take breaks! Maybe doing a quick review of the notes from the day before at the start of the day for a quick refresh. I sometimes found myself losing track of what each lesson contained, so maybe a quick review would help solidify what was in the lesson from the day before.
